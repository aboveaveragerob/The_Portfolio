# Audit — Test / CI / Lint Coverage

**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Scope:** Automated-quality tooling for The_Portfolio (SvelteKit, adapter-static).
**Status:** Findings only. No code, tests, or CI are added by this PR — it documents the
gap and the recommended fix so the owner can decide when to execute.

---

## Finding

The project has **no automated quality gate of any kind**:

- **No tests.** There is no test directory, no `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` files, and no test
  runner in `devDependencies` (no Playwright, no vitest). `package.json` declares only:
  ```json
  "scripts": { "dev": "vite dev", "build": "vite build", "preview": "vite preview" }
  ```
- **No CI.** There is no `.github/` directory, so nothing runs on push or pull request —
  not even `npm run build`. A change that breaks the build or the no-scroll invariant can be
  merged unnoticed.
- **No lint / format.** No ESLint, Prettier, or `svelte-check` is configured or scripted.

### Why this matters here specifically

The redesign's headline guarantee is **"the page must never scroll"** (`DESIGN_AUDIT.md` §8.4),
enforced entirely through CSS grid + `overflow: hidden` + `clamp()`/`dvh` sizing in
`src/routes/+page.svelte` and the components. That invariant is:

- **Fragile** — any content or type change can push a control out of the viewport, and because
  the body is `overflow: hidden`, the overflow is *clipped, not scrolled*, so it fails silently
  (this exact "clipped-not-scrolled" bug was caught mid-build per `REDESIGN_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`).
- **Currently verified only manually and ad-hoc** — each session re-runs a throwaway headless
  Chromium script. Nothing is committed, so the guarantee is re-proved by hand every time and
  regressions between sessions are invisible.

`DESIGN_QA_HANDOFF.md` §Tooling-notes already recommends promoting that throwaway driver into a
committed regression test. This is the single highest-leverage durable artifact the repo is
missing.

## Recommendation (for a future implementation PR — not done here)

1. **Add a Playwright regression test** (Chromium is already available globally at
   `/opt/pw-browsers`; do **not** run `playwright install`). Cover:
   - **No-scroll assertion** `document.scrollingElement.scrollHeight <= innerHeight` across the
     full matrix from `DESIGN_QA_HANDOFF.md` §A:
     - baseline `390 / 768 / 1280`
     - landscape / short height `740×360`, `812×375`, `900×450` (tightest budget)
     - tall desktop `1440×900`, `1920×1080`
     - browser zoom `125% / 150% / 200%` (WCAG reflow)
   - in each of the **landing, open, and reading** states.
   - **Visible-bounding-box checks** for the CTA button, podium, and book footer — assert they
     are actually *within* the viewport, not merely that the page didn't scroll (guards the
     clipped-not-scrolled failure).
   - **Internal scroll** works: a long/multi-page book (Music, Woodworking) scrolls inside the
     reader while the page stays fixed.
   - **Functional flow** with no console errors: shelf → open → switch book → TOC → chapter →
     page-flip (prev/next) → Contents → close, exercising an image book (Eddie Bauer) and an
     audio book (Music).
   - **No hydration warning** on hard load (the seeded starfield in `Backdrop.svelte` must render
     identically server/client).
2. **Add a GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running `npm ci` → `npm run
   build` → the Playwright test on every PR and on push to `main`.
3. **Optionally add `svelte-check` + Prettier** and a `lint` script, wired into the same workflow.
4. Add a `test` (and `lint`) script to `package.json` so the gate is runnable locally.

### Out of scope / stays owner-owned

Real-font rendering (webfonts are proxy-blocked in the build sandbox), production Lighthouse
scores, and mid/low-end-mobile FPS must be validated on real hardware against the deployed
Netlify site — automation cannot close those. See `DESIGN_QA_HANDOFF.md` §D–§F.
